This is infact the easiest ROBLOX Screenshare script there is to set up. I'll walk though with ya.

1. Download Visual Studio Code if you haven't already. Link is [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Open up the Python script in Visual Studio Code.

3. Download Roblox Studio if you haven't already. Link is [here](https://www.roblox.com/download).

4. Open the Lua script in roblox studio. (Copy and paste basically.)

5. Make a giant wall full of 1 by 1 studs in a screen like shape. (Automating is a lot easier using scripts, do that instead.) (If you want it to be smaller, put less parts in the Python script.)

6. Use some port forwarding software like Playit.gg. Download it [here](https://playit.gg/). (Make sure it is the same port number when setting up your link!)

7. Add the link you get from Playit.gg to the Lua script.

8. Run the Python script in Visual Studio Code and run studio with that script.

9. I can see myself!

That's all you really gotta do! If you are good at script, change to your hearts content!
